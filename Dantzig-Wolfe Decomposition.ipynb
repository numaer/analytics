    "# Dantzig-Wolfe Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "In large-scale optimization complicating constraints are constraints that couple different units together. THe rest of the constraints are easy constraints, that refer to each unit. When we remove the complicating constraint, the rest of the constraints become simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps for Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Partition the constraints into complicating constraints and easy constraints.\n",
    "2. Use extreme point representation for P to represent the easy constraints.\n",
    "3. Substitute P into the original problem in lambda space.\n",
    "4. Apply column generation to solve master problem.\n",

    "At a high level, the steps to applying column generation are:\n",
    "1. Start with a susbet of columns I to form the restricted master problem (RMP)\n",
    "2. Solve RMP and get the optimal dual variables, $\\hat{y}$ and $\\hat{r}$\n",
    "3. Check optimality of the RMPs primal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dantzig-Wolfe is a coordinated distributed optimization problem. The RMP handles complicated coupling constraints by finding dual variables. Then it passes the dual variables to each unit (pricing problem). Based off the results of the pricing problem, it informs the RMP whether it is optimal or not. This process repeats."
