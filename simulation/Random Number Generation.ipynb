    "\n",
    "Key ideas of pseudo-random numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Algorithms to produce PRNs are relatively deterministic\n",
    "2. We can choose PRNs to mimic true random uniform which statistical tests can pass\n",
    "3. PRNs are the building blocks of simulations; we can transform PRNs to any distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties of PRN algos:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Appears to be i.i.d uniform (e.g. Unif(0,1))\n",
    "* fast (may need to generate trillions)\n",
    "* reproducable (e.g. via seeds)\n",

    "__Goal__: Give an algorithm that produces a sequence of pseudo random numbers that appear to be i.i.d uniform."

    "R_i = \\frac{X_i}{m}\n",

    "\n",
    "Need to carefully choose a, c, m to ensure long period/cycle length before starts to repeat. Some notes:\n",
    "* c=0 is a multiplicative generator\n",
    "* A full period generator is one with cycle length = m\n",

    "Some good, but not so good examples of LCGs:\n",

    "Use binary numbers to generator PRNs. Define a sequency of binary numbers: $B_1, B_2 ..$ using $B_i = (B_{i-r} + B_{i-q}) \\mod 2$. If $B_{i-r} = B_{i-q}$ then $B_i=0$ else $B_i=1$)\n",
