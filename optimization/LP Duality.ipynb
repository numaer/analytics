    "# LP Duality\n",
    "\n",
    "Duality is important in solving linear programs because they can be easier to solve than the original LP. Dual problems can be \"relaxed\" problems that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Have an objective function less than or equal to the original LP objective function\n",
    "* Larger feasible region than the original LP.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the goal of duality is to find the largest lower bound to the original program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us define a generic form for **LP Primal**:\n",

    "* If the optimal cost of the primal minimization problem is $-\\inf$, then the dual maximization problem must be infeasible.\n",
    "* If the optimal cost of the dual maximization problem is $+\\inf$, then the primal minimization problem must be infeasible.\n",
    "* Let **x*** be feasible to the primal problem and **y*** be feasible to the dual problem. Supposed $c^Tx* = b^Ty*$, then x* and y* are optimal solutions to the primal and dual problems respectively.\n",

    "** Strong Duality: **\n",
    "\n",
    "* General idea: If a primal LP has a finite optimal solution (x\\*), then its dual linear program will also have a finite optimal solution (y*). There is strong duality if the respective optimal objective values are equal ($c^Tx* = b^Ty*$)\n",
    "* If strong duality holds between a pair of primal and dual LPs, then both programs MUST have a finite optimum.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let **x** and **y** be feasible solutions to the primal and dual problems respectively. Then **x** and **y** are optimal solutions for the two respective problems if and only if they satisfy the following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Primal Complementary Slackness: $y_i(a_i^Tx-b_i) = 0$ for all i. In words, either the $i-th$ primal constraint is active (binding, tight) so $a_i^Tx = b_i$, or the corresponding dual variable $y_i=0$\n",
