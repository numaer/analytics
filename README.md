# Deterministic Optimization

Optimization theory lets us formulate programs with variables to minimize (or maximize) functions subject to constraints. 

Notebooks in this repository are best viewed via Jupyter Notebook.

**These notes are heavily based off of Georgia Tech's [ISYE 6669](https://www.edx.org/course/deterministic-optimization-2). The notebooks are personal study references, but should not be substitutes for actual class lectures.**

### Topics

### Glossary

Below are some definitions/terms that come up regularly when dealing with optimization

* Positive Semidefinite - Matrix transformation that tries to keep the vector within a certain halfspace containing the vector ([reference](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/9758/intuitive-explanation-of-a-positive-semidefinite-matrix)).

### Key Prerequisites

* Linear Algebra - Matrices, rank, span, determinants, matrix invertibility, eigenvalues/eigenvectors.
* Calculus - Taylor series, partial derivatives, differentiability, hessians
* Set Theory - Boundedness, feasibility, compactness

### Topics of Challenge

Learning the theory takes a combination of intuitively understanding the theory but also practicing through problems. The following topics within optimization should be worked through thoroughly: 

* Simplex Method
* Column/Constraint Generation
* Dantzig-Wolfe Decomposition
* Primal LP to Dual LP
